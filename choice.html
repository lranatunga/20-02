    <!-- ### Create using JS an unordered list with 4 items.

The items should contain the following texts:

1. "What is your favorite song?"
2. "What is your favorite drink?"
3. "What is your favorite food?"
4. "What is your favorite hobby?"
 
When each one of them is clicked, a textbox should appear and prompt the user to enter his/her choice.

The program has the following favorites predefined for each corresponding list item:
1. "Birdie song"
2. "Soda"
3. "Pasta"
4. "Scuba"

if user's answer is the same with the program's predefined favorite for the same list item, 
then the program should display an alert or anything else to congratulate the user.

If user's answer is different from the predefined program favorite, then the program should display the message:
"It seems that we have different taste but we still can be friends!"

In any of these two last scenarios, the program should display button/link which when clicked the user should be able to start over.

### **N.B. The program should be able to recognize user's input regardless of letter casing.** -->
