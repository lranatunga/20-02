/**
 * 08 medium to hard
 * Create a simple word guessing game where the user gets infinite tries to guess the word 
 * (like Hangman without the hangman, or like Wheel of Fortune without the wheel and fortune).
 * 
 * Create two global arrays: one to hold the letters of the word (e.g. 'F', 'O', 'X'), 
 * and one to hold the current guessed letters (e.g. it would start with '_', '_', '_' 
 * and end with 'F', 'O', 'X').
 * Write a function called guessLetter that will:
 * Take one argument, the guessed letter.
 * Iterate through the word letters and see if the guessed letter is in there.
 * If the guessed letter matches a word letter, changed the guessed letters array to reflect that.
 * When it's done iterating, it should log the current guessed letters ('F__')
 * and congratulate the user if they found a new letter.
 * It should also figure out if there are any more letters that need to be guessed,
 * and if not, it should congratulate the user for winning the game.
 * Pretend you don't know the word, and call guessLetter multiple times 
 * with various letters to check that your program works.
 * Bonus: Make it more like Wheel of Fortune:
 * Start with a reward amount of $0
 * Every time a letter is guessed, generate a random amount and 
 * reward the user if they found a letter (multiplying the reward if multiple letters found), 
 * otherwise subtract from their reward.
 * When they guess the word, log their final reward amount.
 * Bonus: Make it like Hangman:
 * Keep track of all the guessed letters (right and wrong) and only let the user guess a letter once.
 * If they guess a letter twice, do nothing.
 * Keep track of the state of the hangman as a number (starting at 0), 
 * and subtract or add to that number every time they make a wrong guess.
 * Once the number reaches 6 (a reasonable number of body parts for a hangman), 
 * inform the user that they lost and show a hangman on the log
